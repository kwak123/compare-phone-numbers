# Compare Numbers

Simple tool to naively compare two phone numbers that are stringified.

By naively, that means this function makes a few assumptions:
- inputs will be strings or nothing (null/undefined)
- empty strings compare as true
- strings with no digits will compare as true

Mini test-suite included!
`sh ./test.sh`
